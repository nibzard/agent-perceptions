Currently AI makes a lot of very strange decisions that might not be accurate or the best for the business. Right now in many cases there are smart experienced individuals that look over these decisions. But what happens over time when younger humans don't have that experience because AI did everything for them?
"Being inside a public organization that is slow to introduce new software to improve productivity is frustrating. The IT Department is hesitant to allow new software they do not have the manpower to support. MS Access is an example where users created new methods to complete work years ago. When these creators move on, and something goes haywire on their creation, IT gets a call for help for something they do not support. To prevent getting burnt again, the current approach is not allowing this type of productivity software tool."
This is just the beginning - I can't wait to see what new leaps forwards are coming.
